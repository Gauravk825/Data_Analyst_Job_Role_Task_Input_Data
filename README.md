# Data_Analyst_Job_Role_Task_Input_Data

Objective- The raw products data for a store, needs to be cleaned according to the input
required for a machine learning algorithm.

Input- A csv file which contains the following columns-
1. variant_id (Unique ID of the product variant)
2. title_long (Description of the product variant)

4. handle (Description of the product variant)
5. color (Product Color)

Problems to be solved-
The product_type is an import feature for analysis, and prediction. However, the data we receive has a
lot of missing/ redundant/ false information, which needs to be rectified.
Task 1 - Develop a functionality to clean the product_type column of the data, to treat the following pain
areas-
1. Missing values
2. Spelling Mistakes (necklace/ nklce, sari/ saree, pearl/ parl, maang tika/ maang tikka)
3. Generic product types (like Jewellery for all the products of a jewellery store, Saris & Lehengas)
4. Similar Products with different names (t-shirt/ tshirt, tank tops/women’s tank tops)
